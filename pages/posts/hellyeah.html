Derek Sivers has been a tremendous source of inspiration to me, and I have always enjoyed reading his insightful blogs. 

This post <a href="http://sivers.org/hellyeah">No more yes. It's either HELL YEAH! or no</a> is by far one of my favorites. It's simple, the idea worth doing is the idea that you say 'Hell yeah' to. Otherwise, don't do it. Just say no.
